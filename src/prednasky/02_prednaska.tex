\begin{definition}[Oracle TM]
	\textbf{Oracle} TM is a DTM with an Oracle A (where A is a language) differs from an ordinary DTM by the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Oracle tape (with same alphabet as TM)
		\item 3 special states: QUERY, YES, NO
		\item In QUERY state TM moves to YES state if word on the oracle tape $\in A$ (moves to NO o/w).
			After the answer oracle tape is erased (to reuse space in Space complexity).
		\item Language of the accepted word by an oracle TM M is $L(M, A)$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
	For NTM definition works the same.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
	Ordinary DTM is the same as oracle DTM with $A = \emptyset$.
\end{note}

Consider now a comparison of the oracle DTM, when oracle language A is \emph{not fixed in advance}.
Computation forms a tree, that branches at every QUERY.

\begin{observation}
	Consider NTM vs Oracle DTM.

	"$\Rightarrow$". If NTM M has language $L(M)$, set oracle language $A = L(M)$.
	"$\Leftarrow$". If oracle language is not recognizable (e.g. HALT), we cannot simulate such NTM.
\end{observation}

\begin{definition}[Turing reducibility]
	\emph{Turing reducibility} - let A,B languages.
	We say that A is (deterministically) Turing reducible to B in polynomial time if there $\exists$ an oracle DTM M working in polynomial time such that
	\[ A = L(M, B), A \leq^T B \]
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	$A \in P \Rightarrow A \leq^T \emptyset$. Since we have polynomial time algorithm without any oracle.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[$\TP(A)$]
	Let $A$ be a language, then
	\[ \TP(A) = \{ B | B \leq^T A \} \]
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[$\TP(\C)$]
	Let $\C$ be a set of languages then
	\[ \TP(\C) = \{ B |\, \exists A \in \C: B \leq^T A \} \]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[$\TP(\TP) = \TP$]\label{p_eq_pp}
	\[ \TP(\TP) = \TP \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	$ \TP \subseteq \TP(\TP)$. Let $A \in \TP$, use $A$ as an oracle with 1 QUERY or use empty oracle.

	$\TP(\TP) \subseteq \TP$. Let $B \in \TP(\TP) \iff \exists A \in \TP \exists ODTM\ M: B = L(M, A)$.

	To prove the inclusion, we have to construct ordinary DTM that recognizes $B$.
	Such TM $M_B$ simulates $M$ and whenever $M$ enters QUERY state, simulate $M_A$ to check if word $w$ on oracle tape
	\[ w \in L(M_A) = A \]

	Now we have to check time complexity.

	$M$ makes $p(|x|)$ queries (for $p$ polynomial), as the total number of steps is polynomial.
	Each query word length is at most $p_w(|x|) = t$.
	Every query has at most $p_q(|t|)$ steps.
	In total, query is $p_q(p_w(|x|))$.
	And the total time complexity of the TM is $p(p_q(p_w(|x|)))$.
	Which is also polynomial.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Turing reducibility (N)]
	\emph{Turing reducibility (non-deterministic)} - let A,B languages.
	We say that $A$ is non-deterministically Turing reducible to $B$ in polynomial time if there $\exists$ an oracle NTM $M$ working in polynomial time such that
	\[ A = L(M, B), A \leq^{NP} B \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[$\TNP(A)$]
	Let $A$ be a language, then
	\[ \TNP(A) = \{ B | B \leq^{NP} A \} \]
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[$\TNP(\C)$]
	Let $\C$ be a set of languages then
	\[ \TNP(\C) = \{ B |\, \exists A \in \C: B \leq^{NP} A \} \]
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
	Relativized definition also works for other classes, e.g. EXPTIME.
\end{note}

\begin{definition}[PS]
	\[ PS = \bigcup_{i = 0}^{\infty} DS(n^i) = NPS = \bigcup_{i = 0}^{\infty} NS(n^i) \]
	Where the 2nd equality holds because of Savic theorem \cref{savic}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[PS(A)]
	$PS(A) = \{ B | \, B$ accepted by an oracle DTM working in polynomial space, st $B = L(M, A)\}$.

	Also for class of languages $\C$.
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
	\[ \TP \subseteq \TNP \subseteq PS \]

	Where last inclusion hold because of $NT(f(n)) \subseteq DS(f(n))$.

	Same proof but as for ordinary TM, but with oracle TM that shares same oracle language A.
\end{note}

\begin{observation}[Open question]
	What about $\TNP(\TNP)$? Still an open question, depends on $\TP = \TNP$.

	We cannot simply plug NTM back to the original TM with oracle, as NTM serving as an oracle could have multiple accepting or rejecting leaves.
\end{observation}
